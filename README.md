# API Development - Swagger + Docker

## Overview
This is an example of how you to use swagger to accelerate design and develop of APIs and deploy them in a standalone docker container or as a service in a docker swarm.

The sample application exposes two basic API - /hello and /hello/{user} that return a JSON with a welcome message and hostname of server running the application.

## Design
The swagger API definition is located at :  api/swagger.yaml

## Develop
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This is an example of building a node.js server.

This example uses the [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) framework.  To see how to make this your own, look here:

## Deploy

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```


### Creating a docker image
```
docker build -t callmepjs/swagger_docker_demo .
```


### Running application in a docker container
```
docker run --name=api_demo -p 8090:8080 -d callmepjs/swagger_docker_demo
```

### Running the application in a docker swarm
```
$ docker service create --name=api_demo -p 8090:8080 callmepjs/swagger_docker_demo
```

```
$ docker service scale api_demo:5
```
